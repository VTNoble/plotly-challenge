Belly Button Biodiversity

In this repository, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dashboard includes a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs found in the individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample, the sample metadata, and a gauge chart showing the wash frequency.

The dashboard has a selector that allows users to toggle between different individuals' samples, with the charts and table updating when a new sample is selected.
